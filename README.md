## How to Set Up
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Telegram bot token from BotFather.
- RapidAPI key for accessing the GPT API.


#### Installation

**1. Clone the repository:**
```sh
bash
git clone https://github.com/diankaaaa21/Telegram_Bot_Assistant.git
cd Telegram Bot Assistant
```

**2. Install required libraries:**

The bot requires several Python libraries. You can install them using pip:
```sh
bash
pip install requests pytelegrambotapi googletrans emoji pyTelegramBotAPI python-dotenv 
```

**3. Create a .env file:**

The bot requires environment variables. In the root directory, create a .env file and add the following lines:

```sh
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
API_KEY=your_rapidapi_key
```

**4. Set up the environment:**

- Replace the bot token in the script:
```sh
python
bot = telebot.TeleBot('YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN')
```
- Replace the RapidAPI key:
```sh
python
headers = {
    "x-rapidapi-key": "YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY",
    "x-rapidapi-host": "chatgpt-42.p.rapidapi.com",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

**5. Add the required image (gpt.png) for the /start command in the same directory.**

#### Running the Bot
Run the script using Python:
```sh
bash
python bot.py
```


### Commands
- /start: 
Initiates interaction with the bot.

- Prompts the user to choose their preferred language.

- /history: 
Displays the user's command history, including the commands and associated texts.


### Logging

The bot logs all key events in the stderr.txt file. If there are any errors or problems with the API, you will find detailed information in this file.
#### Possible Errors
- API Error: If the API is unresponsive or there is a network issue, the bot will display an error message.
- Missing Tokens: If the .env file does not contain values for TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN or API_KEY, the bot will terminate with an error.


### Code Overview

#### Main Components

**1. Language Selection:**

- The bot provides buttons for Russian and English using a custom keyboard.
- User language preference is saved in a dictionary (user_data).

**2. Question Handling:**

- The bot accepts free-text questions and forwards them to the ChatGPT API.
- Responses are translated into Russian if required.

**3. History Logging:**

- Each interaction is logged in a history_data dictionary.
- The /history command retrieves and displays this information.

**4. API Integration:**

- Utilizes the RapidAPI endpoint for querying GPT responses.

#### Error Handling
- Logs API and bot errors to the console.
- Notifies users if something goes wrong.
